//Time Complexity: O(2^N) { This problem involves two function calls for each iteration which further expands to 4 function calls and so on which makes worst-case time complexity to be exponential in nature }.
//Space Complexity: O(N) { At maximum there could be N function calls waiting in the recursion stack since we need to calculate the Nth Fibonacci number for which we also need to calculate (N-1) Fibonacci numbers before it }.
