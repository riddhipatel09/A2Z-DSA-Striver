Problem Statement: Youâ€™re given an sorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].

The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.


SOLUTION:
We are going to solve this problem using the concepts of Lower Bound and Binary Search. 
FLOOR= largest element in the array <= x
CEIL=  smallest element in the array >= x

The implementation of Ceil will be the same as the lower bound algorithm.

  
  
 CODE: 
  
  #include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int findFloor(int arr[], int n, int x) {
	int low = 0, high = n - 1;
	int ans = -1;

	while (low <= high) {
		int mid = (low + high) / 2;
		// maybe an answer
		if (arr[mid] <= x) {
			ans = arr[mid];
			//look for smaller index on the left
			low = mid + 1;
		}
		else {
			high = mid - 1; // look on the right
		}
	}
	return ans;
}

int findCeil(int arr[], int n, int x) {
	int low = 0, high = n - 1;
	int ans = -1;

	while (low <= high) {
		int mid = (low + high) / 2;
		// maybe an answer
		if (arr[mid] >= x) {
			ans = arr[mid];
			//look for smaller index on the left
			high = mid - 1;
		}
		else {
			low = mid + 1; // look on the right
		}
	}
	return ans;
}

pair<int, int> getFloorAndCeil(int arr[], int n, int x) {
	int f = findFloor(arr, n, x);
	int c = findCeil(arr, n, x);
	return make_pair(f, c);
}

int main() {
	int arr[] = {3, 4, 4, 7, 8, 10};
	int n = 6, x = 5;
	pair<int, int> ans = getFloorAndCeil(arr, n, x);
	cout << "The floor and ceil are: " << ans.first
	     << " " << ans.second << endl;
	return 0;
}


//Output: The floor and ceil are: 4 7

//Time Complexity: O(logN), where N = size of the given array.
//Reason: We are basically using the Binary Search algorithm.
//Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using no extra space.
